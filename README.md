# js-exercise

At first I didn't really understand JS at all. Even after Sololearn, Neil & Steve's watches and the js games we played. But as I have my collegues inspire me with their code and their personal help I beleive I will get to fulfill my grasp of JS more and more and maybe even come to like it one day because I don't yet.

Thank you for listening to my TEDtalk.

PS: I'll try not to forget to update my README

MORNING SICCO

I have .DS_Store files everywhere on my laptop, in every folder. Having trouble commiting because of it...

still stuck on 4 reading this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49485821/date-month-year-dropdown-type-date-picker/49485997 to see what I can do

That concludes the "work-from-home day".

Sicco not that I want to seem like a suck-up but I hope whatever family related issues you had to leave early for don't cost you too much sleep and peace of mind. See you when we see you.
