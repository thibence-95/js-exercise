# js-exercise

At first I didn't really understand JS at all. Even after Sololearn, Neil & Steve's watches and the js games we played. But as I have my collegues inspire me with their code and their personal help I beleive I will get to fulfill my grasp of JS more and more and maybe even come to like it one day because I don't yet.

Thank you for listening to my TEDtalk.

PS: I'll try not to forget to update my README
