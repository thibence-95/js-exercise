# JavaScript

At first I didn't understand JS at all. I do admit I often do copy (not ctrl C - ctrl V) from others but as I type out the syntaxes for the exercises I am starting to get a grasp of what how the code works. I don't like it that much yet but I'm sure that's yet to come. Thank you for listening to my TEDtalk.
